  """
  This code determines if a vector described by coefficients a and b is a valid quantum state.
  It checks if the probabilities (squares of the amplitudes) sum to 1, according to the Born rule.

  Args:
    a: The coefficient of the |0⟩ state.
    b: The coefficient of the |1⟩ state.

  Returns:
    "yes" if the vector is a valid quantum state (within a small tolerance), 
    "no" otherwise.
